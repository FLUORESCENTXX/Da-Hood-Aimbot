# Da-Hood-Aimbot
- - - - 

A ahk script aimbot for Da Hood (locks on to head) it also sometimes might go randomly to the chest or the legs thats because the color rgb sometimes changes in the game and the script may not be able to read it so yeah

# IMPORTANT 

Please note that this is also undetected and **may** get you a ban if you use it too blatantly you could get a ban from Da Hood. Also please read how to use this before ask me on how it works cuz some 9 year olds keep asking for blox game hacks and don't know how to use it

(Basically just locks on to the pixels of a character in Da Hood and shoots :D)

This also messed up randomly it also just randomly goes round and round

# HowItWorks
So basically just install autohotkey from the website and make sure to install all the components as it is x64, then run the file from the download button below and open it with ahk show here. Then once it runs you should see a green AHK if u press the arrow on the bottom right of your pc and it will show a AHK symbol that is green. Then it means it is running. Have fun!
